version 0.5.2
- Fixed bugs. Now more tests are working (BT1-BT13, LCH, and various HS)

version 0.5.1
- Minor changes

version 0.5.0
- Changed to
  min f(x)
  s.t c_E(x) = 0
  s.t CL <= c_I(x) <= CU
      BL <= x <= BU
- cuter interface now functional, but the method is not complete yet

version 0.4.0
- Inequalities Included, but only in the following form:
  min f(x)
  s.t c_E(x) = 0
      c_I(x) <= 0
- Still works for the equalities (make eqtests)
- Works all tests but test5
- test5 reach maximum iteratior, probably because A becomes close to singular

version 0.3.0 - Equality only.
- Works with tests and CUTEr
- No long int and int at the same time. Changes should be made at Include/definitions.h (long int should be mantained)
