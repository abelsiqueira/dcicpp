Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------
  This library extends the DCI library in Fortran[1] that sol-
ves nonlinear programming problems with equality cons-
traints. This version is in C++ and solves the problem with
general form

  min f(x)
  s.t c_E(x) = 0
      c_L <= c_I(x) <= c_U
      b_L <= x <= b_U

which is the form used by the CUTEr library[2]. Our version
uses the base_matrices library[3], which is a wrapper for
CHOLMOD[4]. The method is explained in [5].
