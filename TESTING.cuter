inside dcicpp, there is a directory called CuterTest. Run the tests inside that directory

With dcicpp compiled for CUTEr, you must use the command

$ runcppcuter -p dcicpp -D <problem_name>

where <problem_name> must be substituded for one problem in the $MASTSIF directory, without the .SIF
For example, to run dcicpp with the HS35.SIF problem, enter

$ runcppcuter -p dcicpp -D HS35

Obs.: runcppcuter is a modification of the runcuter routine to work with C++
